    <h2>Together, We Can Make a Change üåç</h2>
    <p>Plastic is everywhere‚Äîbut so is our power to choose. Avoid single-use plastics, recycle when you can, and support eco-friendly alternatives. Every small action leads to a bigger impact. The planet needs us. Let‚Äôs rise to the challenge.</p>

  <section id="intro">
    <h2>What is Plastic?</h2>
    <p>Plastic is a synthetic material made from polymers, long chains of molecules derived mostly from petroleum. It's used in nearly every industry due to its flexibility, strength, and low cost.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="process">
    <h2>How is Plastic Made?</h2>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Extraction:</strong> Crude oil is extracted and transported to refineries.</li>
      <li><strong>Refining:</strong> Oil is processed into chemicals like ethylene and propylene.</li>
      <li><strong>Polymerization:</strong> These chemicals are linked into long chains (polymers).</li>
      <li><strong>Forming:</strong> The polymers are melted, molded, or extruded into products.</li>
    </ol>

  <section id="destruction">
    <h2>Why is Destroying Plastic So Complex?</h2>
    <p>Plastics are designed to last. Their chemical bonds are extremely stable, meaning they resist natural breakdown. Most plastics can't be biodegraded and require high-temperature incineration, which is expensive and releases toxic gases. Recycling isn't simple either‚Äîdifferent plastics must be separated, cleaned, and processed individually.</p>
    <p>This complexity makes plastic destruction a slow, costly, and often environmentally harmful process.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="impact">
    <h2>How Does Plastic Harm the Environment?</h2>
    <p>Every year, millions of tons of plastic end up in our oceans and landfills. Animals mistake it for food, leading to internal blockages, suffocation, and death. Microplastics‚Äîtiny plastic fragments‚Äîcontaminate water, air, and even our food.</p>
    <p>Burning plastic releases carcinogenic fumes, while improper disposal clogs drainage systems, causes flooding, and pollutes soil and groundwater.</p>
